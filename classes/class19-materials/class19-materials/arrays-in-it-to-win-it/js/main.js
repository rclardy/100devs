//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["Top Gun", "Avatar", "Star Wars"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let first = movies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let movieLengnth = movies.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let last = movies[movies.length - 1];
console.log(last);
